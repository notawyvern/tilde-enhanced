## Important Notes

### Tweaking

You can change it in [config.js](js/config.js), but features are few. Why? I use NixOS, a *declarative* system. My personal setup references this repository. It is easier to mantain if I have less to.

### Dependencies

To work out of the box, the DepartureMono Nerd Font should be installed. The Tao symbol button needs NF to render it. You can modify the icon in [ui.sh](./Homepage/js/ui.sh) and the font in [style.css](./Homepage/css/style.css).

## Setting it up for new tabs on Firefox

By default Firefox won't let you set a custom URL for new tabs but there is a work-around to circumvent the problem.

You can follow [Urimu's Guide](https://github.com/Urimu/Startpage#setting-it-up-on-firefox) to set your new tab to launch custom URLs.
